# Introduction
We will be exploring how Base64 works in the SMTP (simple mail transfer protocal) for converting raw binary data like images into text for transmission in the network.

## tools used
1. Base64 one
2. Wireshark 

## Procedure to see the work of Base64 encoding in SMTP.

## Step 1: opening the Base64 one and inserting the data.

At first we will open the Base64 one application. It is a free application to show how data is converted into ASCII text using Base64 encoding.
